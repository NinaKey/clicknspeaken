Red like an apple, round and sweet and
bright. Orange like a pumpkin glowing in
the night. Yellow like the sunshine

shining from above. Green like the tall
grass waving with a shove. Blue like the
ocean. Deep and cool and wide. Purple
like a grape, hidden right inside. Pink

like the flowers dancing in the breeze.
Brown like the chocolate. Yummy if you
please. Colors all around us. Everywhere
we see. Learning colors is so fun. Come
sing along with me.

White like snowflakes falling from the
sky. Black like the nighttime when the
Colors All Around Us. Stars are high. 
Colors all around us.
Everywhere we see. Learning colors is so
fun. Come sing along with me. Colors all
around us. Everywhere we see. Learning
colors is so fun. Come sing along with
me.">
